### Description

A 2D Windows-based game. You can construct various buildings, roads, destroy them, earn money through monthly taxes, scroll around the terrain.... all like a professional strategy game! inspired from my favorite dos-based game Transport Tycoon Deluxe by Chris Sawyer, Micropose. Graphics are drawn on the basis of flicker-free drawing concept. Great frame rate. Ive also made support for full-screen mode. Actually in Full-Screen mode, the game switches the screen resolution to 640x480 size so it wont have to stretch the graphics. Anywayz.. contains load and loads of stuff which i cant even explain here. Ive got some great great stuff for amateur programmers. I was planning to make a proper game out of it but the frame rate didnt supported enough and im no good at directx so i kept the game only to a little coding demonstration. Try it out dudes!!! plz vote.. means very much to me! .... IMPORTANT: Please please dont forget to read the README.TXT file first to see the recommended system requirements for this game. [UPDATIONS]: Load/Save map, better framerate, new effect on selecting buildings.
